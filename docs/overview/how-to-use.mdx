## How to Use

<Precompiler/>

For all projects in the [official examples](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer-examples):

-   All Java examples have both `pom.xml` and `build.gradle`, i.e., they support both Maven and Gradle.

    When opening these projects for the first time, IntelliJ will ask you how you want to open them, and you can make your choice.

    If you want to switch the opening method, exit IntelliJ, delete the hidden directory `.idea` in the project, and then open the project with IntelliJ again and reselect the method.

-   All Kotlin examples only have the `build.gradle.kts` file, i.e., they only support Gradle. The reason has been explained earlier.

IntelliJ has some rash over-optimization measures for integrating annotation processors introduced via Maven, resulting in a better development experience when using Gradle with the IDE than with Maven.

## Where to Use

Business projects are rarely a single project, but more often split into multiple subprojects using build tools like Maven and Gradle.

So, in which subprojects should we use the configurations mentioned earlier?

|Subproject Type|Usage|Notes|
|--------|-------|-----------------|
|Projects defining entities|Generate necessary code based on entity definitions, such as Draft, SQL DSL, Fetcher||
|Projects defining DTO files under `src/main/dto`|Generate DTO classes based on the DTO language code|For Java, unless the current subproject has entity definitions, you need to find any class and annotate it with `@EnableDtoGeneration`|
|Projects using Spring Web annotations|Automatically generate OpenAPI documentation and TypeScript code, writing Java/Kotlin documentation comments into the documentation and client code; support for remote exceptions||
